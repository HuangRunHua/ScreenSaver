# Quick Start

`Player` is available for installation using the Cocoa dependency manager [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/).  Alternatively, you can simply copy the `Player.swift` file into your Xcode project.

```ruby
# CocoaPods
pod "Player", "~> 0.13.0"

# Carthage
github "piemonte/Player" ~> 0.13.0
```

## Usage

The sample project provides an example of how to integrate `Player`, otherwise you can follow these steps.

Allocate and add the `Player` controller to your view hierarchy.

``` Swift
 self.player = Player()
 self.player.playerDelegate = self
 self.player.playbackDelegate = self
 self.player.view.frame = self.view.bounds

 self.addChild(self.player)
 self.view.addSubview(self.player.view)
 self.player.didMove(toParent: self)
```

Provide the file path to the resource you would like to play locally or stream. Ensure you're including the file extension.

``` Swift
let videoUrl: URL = // file or http url
self.player.url = videoUrl
```

play/pause/chill

``` Swift
 self.player.playFromBeginning()
```

Adjust the fill mode for the video, if needed.

``` Swift
 self.player.fillMode = PlayerFillMode.resizeAspectFit.avFoundationType
```

Display video playback progress, if needed.

``` Swift
extension ViewController: PlayerPlaybackDelegate {

    public func playerPlaybackWillStartFromBeginning(_ player: Player) {
    }

    public func playerPlaybackDidEnd(_ player: Player) {
    }

    public func playerCurrentTimeDidChange(_ player: Player) {
        let fraction = Double(player.currentTime) / Double(player.maximumDuration)
        self._playbackViewController?.setProgress(progress: CGFloat(fraction), animated: true)
    }

    public func playerPlaybackWillLoop(_ player: Player) {
        self. _playbackViewController?.reset()
    }

}
```
